Steps I am taking to build this web app :-

1. npx create-next-app@latest
2. npm i antd axios redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken firebase moment
3. Overiding the AntD with tailwind CSS = 1. We can simply use the !important and use that,
   --2nd = themeProviders & receive the themeProvider as children & after this go to layout.jsx and wrap the themePrvider as parent = https://ant.design/components/config-provider

4. then Working on backend = 1.dbCOnnection, routes = register, login , middlwares, frontend
